# Calculator Mockup
a front-end only project built to showcase mockup skills

## What’s Inside?
This is a React app, built with Vite. No heavy UI or styling frameworks like Bootstrap or Tailwind—just vanilla CSS for styling.

## Features

	•	Dynamic Rendering: Toggle the reference image on and off to compare the mockup to its source image
	•	Vanilla CSS: All the styling is done with pure CSS, no CSS-in-JS, no preprocessors—just old-school, readable styles.
